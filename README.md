# SchreckNet Lite

Unofficial Vampire: The Masquerade V20/V5 interactive character sheet.  
Fan-made project built with **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

> [!NOTE]
> V20 Sheet is...fully complete! Fully functional sheet, complete with the freebie mode! I do plan on expanding the Nature/Demeanor list, since I was trawling through the wiki, and adding tooltips. I am currently working on styling the V5 sheet, though I don't know when I'll finish it.

## üìå About the project

The goal is to recreate a simple, interactive character sheet for **Vampire: The Masquerade**, starting with **V20** and later adding **V5** support.  
It is inspired by the [SchreckNet](https://www.schrecknet.live/) character sheet site and by existing fan projects, especially [VTMsite](https://github.com/DrSharky/VTMsite) by DrSharky. ‚ù§Ô∏è

For now, the scope is **just** the sheet UI ‚Äî dots, dropdowns, form inputs, and basic V20 freebie point calculations.  
No saving, exporting, or login features yet.  

This is a **pure front-end project** built with a modern toolchain for a fast development experience. Future plans include moving to React, adding backend functionality, and expanding the toolset.

## üîß Tech Stack

-   **Vite:** Serves as the build tool and development server.
-   **HTML5:** For the core structure of the character sheets.
-   **Tailwind CSS:** For all styling and the utility-first CSS framework.
-   **Vanilla JavaScript:** For all client-side interactivity.

## üöÄ Running Locally

This project uses Vite for a fast and modern development experience.

**Prerequisites:**
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.x or higher is recommended)
-   npm (which comes included with Node.js)

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/overuseofrem/schrecknet-lite.git
    cd schrecknet-lite
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start a local server (usually at `http://localhost:5173`). The site will automatically reload as you make changes to the source files.

4.  **Build for production:**
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```
    This command bundles the entire project into a `/dist` directory. This is the exact process used by the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy the site.
