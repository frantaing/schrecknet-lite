# SchreckNet Lite

Unofficial Vampire: The Masquerade V20/V5 interactive character sheet.  
Fan-made project using Tailwind CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## 📌 About the project

The goal is to recreate a simple, interactive character sheet for **Vampire: The Masquerade**, starting with **V20** and later adding **V5** support.  
It is inspired by the [SchreckNet](https://www.schrecknet.live/) character sheet site and by existing fan projects, especially [VTMsite](https://github.com/DrSharky/VTMsite) by DrSharky. ❤️

For now, the scope is **just** the sheet UI — dots, dropdowns, form inputs, and basic V20 freebie point calculations.  
No saving, exporting, or login features yet.  

This is a **pure front-end project** for now, using **Tailwind CSS** and **vanilla JavaScript**. Future plans include moving to React, adding backend functionality, and expanding the toolset.
