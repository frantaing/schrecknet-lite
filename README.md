## 📌 About the project

The goal is to recreate a simple, interactive character sheet for **Vampire: The Masquerade**, starting with **V20** and later adding **V5** support.  
It is heavily inspired by the [SchreckNet](https://www.schrecknet.live/) character sheet site and by existing fan projects, especially [VTMsite](https://github.com/DrSharky/VTMsite) by DrSharky. ❤️

This is a **pure front-end application** that runs entirely in your browser. No data is saved, and no login is required.

## ✨ Features (V20 Sheet)

The V20 sheet now fully implements the character creation process from the core rulebook:

-   **Interactive Dot System:** Click to assign points to Attributes, Abilities, Disciplines, Backgrounds, and Virtues.
-   **Rule-Aware Point Allocation:**
    -   Separate, managed point pools for each character creation stage.
    -   Point counters that update in real-time.
    -   Prevents spending more points than are available.
-   **Dynamic & Intelligent Dropdowns:**
    -   Clan selection automatically populates in-clan Disciplines.
    -   Dynamically add or remove rows for Disciplines, Backgrounds, Merits, and Flaws.
    -   Prevents duplicate selections for a valid character sheet.
-   **Complete Freebie Point System:**
    -   Enter a final, dedicated "Freebie Mode" to spend your initial 15 points.
    -   Strict enforcement of Freebie Point costs for all traits.
    -   Gain up to 7 additional points by selecting Flaws, with Merit options dynamically updating based on available points.
-   **Derived Stat Calculation:** Humanity/Path and Willpower are automatically calculated and updated based on Virtue scores.
- **Light mode:** Toggle between classic dark mode and now, you can burn your eyes off with light mode!
-   **Export Your Sheet:** When finished, save your character sheet as a formatted `.txt` file or a print-ready PDF.
